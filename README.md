Introducing my new SQL project - Pizza Shop Analysis. In this project I have analyzed the historical data of a pizza shop which consisted pizza's of various categories, sizes and types. The level of questions solved in this projects ranges from regular to advanced level SQL queries.

Furthermore, I conducted analysis on the revenue generated by the sales and orders of the shop. I used four datasets which comprised of pizzas, pizza_types, orders and order_details for this project. By using these datasets I solved various queries related to the sales and orders of the shop.

Functions such as over(), Rank(), various TIME functions and aggregate functions like count(), sum(), avg(),etc. Important concepts such as Sub-queries , Joins , group by clause , Order by clause, etc were also used for tackling most of the questions.

Building this project was a great learning experience as it helped showcase my SQL skills and refined my SQL knowledge. My journey of learning SQL has been really great and I made me feel really confident in solving SQL queries.
